## Coding Standards

* PHP Version: Target PHP 7.4+.
* Style: Follow PSR-12 coding standards.
   * Use declare(strict_types=1) for strict typing.
   * Run composer install to ensure dependencies align with composer.json.


* Tests: Add or update tests in tests/ using PHPUnit (^9.5).
   * Aim for high test coverage, especially for new features or bug fixes.


* Documentation:
   * Update README.md for new features or changes to usage.
   * Add PHPDoc comments for new classes, methods, or parameters.

* Test Locally: Run vendor/bin/phpunit before submitting a pull request.
* Marketplace Support: Ensure changes work across all supported marketplaces (US, UK, JP, DE, FR, CA, AU, IN).
* Security: Follow security best practices, such as avoiding hardcoded credentials and ensuring HTTPS usage.

## Community

* Join discussions in the Issues or Discussions tabs.
* Contact the maintainer (@yourgithubusername) for questions or clarification.
